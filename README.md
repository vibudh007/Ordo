# Ordo — GNOME Top Panel Window Buttons

**Ordo** is a GNOME Shell extension that moves window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close) from each window’s titlebar to a single location on the top panel.

## Motivation

Instead of each window having its own set of buttons, **Ordo** provides a single global set on the top panel to reduce redundancy and save screen space.

---

## Installation

Download and install **Ordo** directly from GNOME Extensions:

[Ordo on GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8686/ordo/)

* Use the toggle on the website to enable the extension.
* GNOME Shell will automatically hide native titlebar buttons while active.

---

## Usage

* Buttons appear at the **top-right of the GNOME panel**.
* Click **Minimize**, **Maximize**, or **Close** to control the focused window.
* Disabling the extension restores native titlebar buttons.
